                    <p class="book">This morning, Kady thought breaking up with Ezra was the hardest thing she’d have to
                        do.

                        This afternoon, her planet was invaded.

                        The year is 2575, and two rival megacorporations (United Terran Authorities (UTA) and BeiTech)
                        are at war over a planet that’s little more than an ice-covered speck at the edge of the
                        universe. Too bad nobody thought to warn the people living on it. With enemy fire raining down
                        on them, Kady and Ezra—who are barely even talking to each other—are forced to fight their way
                        onto an evacuating fleet, with an enemy warship in hot pursuit.

                        But their problems are just getting started. A deadly plague has broken out and is mutating,
                        with terrifying results; the fleet's AI, which should be protecting them, may actually be their
                        enemy; and nobody in charge will say what’s really going on. As Kady hacks into a tangled web of
                        data to find the truth, it's clear only one person can help her bring it all to light: the
                        ex-boyfriend she swore she'd never speak to again.</p>

                        of Hanna’s social life. Nobody said it might actually get her killed.

                        The sci-fi saga that began with the breakout bestseller Illuminae continues on board the Jump
                        Station Heimdall, where two new characters will confront the next wave of the BeiTech assault.

                        Hanna is the station captain’s pampered daughter; Nik the reluctant member of a notorious crime
                        family. But while the pair is struggling with the realities of life aboard the galaxy’s most
                        boring space station, little do they know that Kady Grant and the Hypatia are headed right
                        toward Heimdall, carrying news of the Kerenza invasion.

                        When an elite BeiTech strike team invades the station, Hanna and Nik are thrown together to
                        defend their home. But alien predators are picking off the station residents one by one, and a
                        malfunction in the station’s wormhole means the space-time continuum might be ripped in two
                        before dinner. Soon Hanna and Nik aren’t just fighting for their own survival; the fate of
                        everyone on the Hypatia—and possibly the known universe—is in their hands.

                        But relax. They’ve totally got this. They hope.</p>

                        Too bad he just caught up with her.

                        Asha survived the initial BeiTech's assault and has been working undercover with the hopelessly
                        outmatched resistance ever since. That, and figuring out what to do with the secret she's
                        stashed in the crawlspace. The last thing she expected to worry about was her ex-boyfriend, but
                        Rhys Lindstrom just landed planetside, and he's looking finer than ever in his new BeiTech
                        uniform. Is her way out ― or a guarantee she never gets off this frozen rock alive?

                        But Asha's not the only one with problems. Her cousin Kady's ragtag band of survivors are headed
                        for Kerenza ― without enough oxygen to last the journey. Oh, and there might be an insurrection
                        brewing. But when have little things like that ever stopped the Illuminae Group?

                        Too bad time isn't on their side. With BeiTech hurrying to repair their damaged jump gate, and a
                        mass extermination planned for the Kerenza civilians, only a miracle could save them now. And
                        everyone knows that miracles are just statistical probabilities ... right?</p>
